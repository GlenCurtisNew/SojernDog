### Things I would of added if I was to expand on the site (Had more time)
- Add smooth animations to adding / removing dogs from favorites
- Load the dogs in more smoothly on the homepage (Add default sizes to initial flexboxes)
- Custom toast component that matches the style of the site
- Updated colours and general UI/UX
- There is a chance that you can get duplicates as we are not checking the hash against other hashes already in the array
